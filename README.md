**Ubuntu-Respinner**

A script to respin and maintain Ubuntu ISO file releases.

Usage:

1) Place in a working directory on a medium large enough to hold the original iso file, the extracted iso contents, and a working linux filesystem (in total, about four times the size if the original iso file).
2) Edit the paths and username in the script.
3) Make the script executable.
4) Run as root in a terminal.
